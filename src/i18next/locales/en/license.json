Specifically, as per the rules under sections 2.1 and 2.2:</p><p>(a) each User shall have an Agreement under subsection 2.1(a) with the UnSpot entity that corresponds to his domicile according to section 2.2.</p><p>The Agreement referenced in the first paragraph of this subsection: (α) shall be effective upon the earlier of (i) the party to be identified as the User consenting to the Terms, whether explicitly or impliedly, with implied consent being deemed to have been given by the performance of any of the acts mentioned in the definition of “User”, and (ii) the said party becoming identifiable by any of the characteristics used in these Terms to define a User or a Customer (except the attribute “other than the Supplier”); (β) is for an indefinite term, continuing in force until terminated pursuant to its terms or on statutory grounds, except that certain of its provisions (as identified herein) will survive any termination hereof;</p><p>(b) the Subscriber and any User who enjoys any of the benefits of a Service Plan in relation to which he is not the Subscriber shall, as respects the given Service Plan, have an Agreement under subsection 2.1(b) with (i) the UnSpot entity corresponding to the Subscriber’s domicile, in the case of a free Service Plan, or (ii) in the case of a paid Service Plan, the UnSpot entity corresponding to the domicile of the payer.</p><p>The Agreement referenced in the first paragraph of this subsection: (α) between the Supplier and the Subscriber shall be effective upon the Supplier’s acceptance of the order for the Service Plan, whether explicitly or impliedly, with implied acceptance being deemed to have been given by making the relevant Features available; (β) between the Supplier and a User other than the Subscriber shall be effective upon any of the Service Plan’s benefits becoming available to the User; and, in either case (γ) shall terminate upon (i) a new Agreement being made between the Supplier and a Subscriber under subsection 2.1(b) in relation to the Workspace concerned, i.e., where the Service Plan pertaining to the Workspace is replaced by another, (ii) the expiry of the Service Plan, (iii) the User ceasing to be a member of the Workspace (in which event the Agreement in question will only terminate in respect of the particular User), (iv) the Workspace being closed, or (v) the party paying for the Service Plan being replaced by another whose domicile, if the Agreement were made anew with him as the payer, would, as per point (b)(ii) above, cause the same to form with a UnSpot entity other than the current Supplier, or the existing payer’s domicile being changed respectively; (δ) where point (γ)(v) applies, a new Agreement under subsection 2.1(b) shall automatically form with the UnSpot entity corresponding to the new domicile of the payer;</p><p>(c) the Workspace Owner shall always have an Agreement under subsection 2.1(c) with the UnSpot entity having issued the Service Plan then-effective in relation to the given Workspace, i.e., each time that the Workspace becomes subject to an Agreement between the Supplier and a Subscriber under subsections 2.1(b) and 2.3(b) a new Agreement under subsection 2.1(c) shall form between the Workspace Owner and the respective UnSpot entity, with the Owner’s previous Agreement under that subsection terminating respectively (and such re-establishment of contract having no effect on the Service).</p><p>2.4 A separate contract is always formed between the Supplier and each User. No User is party to, or a third-party beneficiary or a protected or otherwise interested third party under, another User’s contract with the Supplier, or can raise any claim based on or in connection with that contract.</p><p>2.5 The Supplier’s undertakings with regard to the Service are to the Customer only and no one else may demand, or shall rely on, the Supplier’s performance of its respective obligations (or any other obligation that the Supplier may have under its Agreement with the Customer).</p>"
